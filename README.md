## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasarunylmzz/test-case.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend-task` directory and run:

     ```bash
     cd frontend-task
     npm install
     ```

## Backend

The backend is written in Go and is located in the `backend-and-tasks` directory.

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend-and-tasks` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend-and-tasks
   ```

2. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

This will execute the main Go program, which includes various task functions.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Next.js and is located in the `frontend-task` directory.

### Running the Frontend

1. Ensure you are in the `frontend-task` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-task
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Algorithms

The `goalgorithms` directory contains solutions to various algorithmic problems implemented in Go. These solutions demonstrate different algorithmic techniques and can be used as a reference for learning and understanding Go programming and algorithm design.

To explore the algorithm solutions, navigate to the `goalgorithms` directory:

```bash
cd goalgorithms
```

You can run individual Go files to see the solutions in action:

```bash
go run task.go
```

## Testing

To run tests for the frontend, ensure you are in the `frontend-task` directory and execute:
